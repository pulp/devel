# This role could be made more idempotent by requesting that packages be
# "present," not "latest." The vim packaging issue could be solved with logic
# that says "if the current platform is Fedora and vim-enhanced isn't installed,
# let vim-minimal be latest."

# Fedora has a packaging problem where vim-enhanced will fail to install if
# vim-minimal is out of date.
