Welcome to the Pulp dev environment!

Here are some tips:
* The 3.0-dev branch is experimental, and my be broken.

* Your code is all checked out inside of ~/devel/.

* There are a set of bash functions in your .bashrc that are useful.

  Run 'phelp' to list the available functions and what they do.

More information can be found at
https://pulp.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dev-guide/ and you can ask questions in
#pulp on Freenode IRC.

Happy hacking, and thanks for your contribution!
